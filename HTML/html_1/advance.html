            <h1><u>What is the introduction of math?</u></h1>

            <p>Mathematics is the <mark>science and study of quality, structure, space, and change.</mark>
                Mathematicians
                seek
                out patterns,
                formulate new conjectures, and establish truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms
                and
                definitions.</p>

            <p>There is debate over whether <i>mathematical objects</i> such as numbers and points exist naturally or
                are
                human
                creations. The mathematician <strong>Benjamin Peirce</strong> called mathematics <q><u> the science that
                        draws
                        necessary conclusions</u></q> .
                <mark>Albert Einstein</mark>, on the other hand, stated
                that <q><u>as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they
                        are
                        certain, they do not refer to reality.</u></q>
            </p>

            <p> <u> Today, mathematics is used throughout the world as an essential tool in many fields, including
                    natural
                    science,
                    engineering, medicine, and the social sciences.</u> Applied mathematics, the branch of mathematics
                concerned
                with
                application of <strong>mathematical knowledge</strong> to other fields, inspires and makes use of new
                mathematical discoveries
                and sometimes leads to the development of entirely new disciplines. Mathematicians also engage in pure
                mathematics, or mathematics for its own sake, without having any application in mind, although practical
                applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered later.

            <h1><u>Introduction to Chemistry</u></h1>

            <p> <mark>Chemistry</mark> is the study of matter—what it consists of, what its properties are, and how it
                changes.
                <u>Being able to
                    describe the ingredients in a cake and how they change when the cake is baked</u> is called
                <strong>chemistry</strong>. Matter is
                anything that has mass and takes up space—that is, anything that is physically real. <mark><i>Some
                        things
                        are
                        easily
                        identified as matter—this book, for example.</i></mark> Others are not so obvious. Because we
                move
                so
                easily through air,
                we sometimes forget that it, too, is matter.
            </p>


            <p><del>Thus, chemistry is the study of matter, biology is the study of living things, and geology is the
                    study
                    of
                    rocks
                    and the earth.</del> Mathematics is the language of science, and we will use it to
                <mark>communicate</mark>
                some of the ideas of
                chemistry.
