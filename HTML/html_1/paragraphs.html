            <h1>About <abbr title="Orange"> Coding Academy</abbr></h1>
            <hr />
            <p> In response to the escalating demand for skilled programmers within both local and regional markets,
                Orange
                Jordan has steadfastly committed itself to nurturing a new generation proficient in these crucial
                skills.
                <mark>The Coding Academy by Orange</mark>, inaugurated in June 2019, in collaboration with Simplon.co,
                embarked
                on its
                mission to provide comprehensive, tuition-free 6-month training courses in coding languages,
                complemented by a
                month-long internship within tech and tech-enabled companies. Each year, students are selected to join
                the
                Academy through a competitive admissions process.
                Building on its initial success, our coding academy graduates now boast an impressive 85% employment
                rate across
                all cohorts. This affirms the efficiency of the academy’s teaching methodology, curricula, and academic
                staff.
                Moreover, the academy has expanded across the kingdom's governorates. It has established academies in
                Irbid,
                Zarqa, Balqa, and Aqaba, further extending its impact and accessibility.
